          <h2 class="main-description-sub">from My Hero Academia</h2>
          <p class="main-description">Toshinori Yagi (八や木ぎ俊とし典のり), also known as All Might (オールマイト Ōru Maito?), was the
            former No. 1 Pro Hero who
            bore the title of the world's Symbol of Peace (平和の象徴 Heiwa no Shōchō?). He teaches Foundational Hero Studies
            at U.A. High School.
            All Might was the eighth holder of the One For All Quirk after receiving it from Nana Shimura. He has since
            passed the torch to Izuku Midoriya, whom he is training to be his successor. After using up all the embers
            of
            One For All to defeat All For One, All Might retired and ended his era as the world's greatest hero.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="container_more_about">
          <p class="more_about">In his empowered form, Toshinori is a very large man with an equally-muscular and
            well-defined physique,
            his design resembling a typical western comic book superhero. He has chiseled features on his face with a
            strong
            jawline and pronounced cheekbones, and bushy eyebrows. He has short blond hair, swept backwards, with two
            distinct tufts that stick up above his head, leaning slightly to each side. His strong features regularly
            casts a dark shadow over his face, hiding everything but his bright blue eyes.</p>

          <div class="container_more_about2">
            <p class="more_about2">In his "true form," after sustaining permanent damage from All For One, Toshinori's
              declining health
              reduced
              him to a very skinny man with sharp, angular features and long limbs, his neck long and his eyebrows
              absent.
              He possesses a large scar that covers most of the left side of his chest, and it is not uncommon for him
              to
              spout blood from his mouth when excited or surprised. He typically wears baggy clothing to accommodate the
              change in body mass between forms, but after the end of Toshinori's tenure as a hero, he starts wearing
              clothes that fit him in his true form, as he no longer needs big clothes that fit his muscle form.</p>
